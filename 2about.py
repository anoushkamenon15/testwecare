        Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a problem with hormones that happens during the reproductive years . If you have PCOS, you may not have periods very often. Or you may have periods that last many days. You may also have too much of a hormone called androgen in your body.With PCOS, many small sacs of fluid develop along the outer edge of the ovary. These are called cysts. The small fluid-filled cysts contain immature eggs. These are called follicles. The follicles fail to regularly release eggs.The exact cause of PCOS is unknown. Early diagnosis and treatment along with weight loss may lower the risk of long-term complications such as type 2 diabetes and heart diseasePolycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive disorders in women and despite this, diagnostic challenges, delayed diagnosis and less than optimal treatment regimens plague the condition. PCOS is a hormonal disorder affecting 6% - 26% of women in the reproductive age group worldwide. Early detection will facilitate timely intervention, helping to manage symptoms and reduce the risk of long-term complications associated with PCOS.
